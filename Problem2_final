## Instrictions: Load the dataset “south_african_heart_disease_data.dta” and estimate the effect of ldl-
##(bad)cholesterol (ldl) in blood on the probability of suffering from heart disease (chd equals 1 if one suffers from it). 

## Loading the data
data <- read.dta(file= "south_african_heart_disease_data.dta") 

## Estimating effect ch ~ ldl

probit<-glm(data$chd~data$ldl,family=binomial(link="probit"))
summary(probit)

##a) [0.5P] Can you learn anything from the estimated coefficients? Explain shortly. ## 

## In non-linear regression models, such as the probit model, coefficients cannot be interpreted as marginal effects. In probit model, the coefficients could 
## be interpreted with respect to the latent variable but since it has no specific unit, we cannot use any meaningful scale.
##Therefore, the coefficients give only the signs of the partial effect of each x on the response probability, and its statistical significance by giving 
## us the information whether we can reject null hypothesis at sufficiently small significance level. In presented model the estimated coefficient of ldl is positive 
## and significant at < 1% level. Therefore, ldl-cholesterol increases the chances of suffering from the disease and is highly significant.
